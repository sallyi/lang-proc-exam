case, we can have a nice bath drawn for you. A real one." 


	***She’s stooping low. I don’t need a bath! I need... sniffsniff...maybe a bath wouldn’t hurt...hmmmm...I can play this game...***


	"I can use my soap. Not your prissy smelling stuff?" 

	Aefre blinked. "Starting tomorrow," she continued with a sigh, "you can take over and organize the rotations and training schedules. The Riders need their routines re-established, as do you. I'm sure Dréogan would like to take a nice ride rather than being lunged. Hmmm?" 


	***I'm being appeased. I know I’m being appeased. I might be a simple Horse Lord, but I’m not stupid. I'll take it!*** 


	"An honest - to - Béma ride?" 

	They passed Willan in the hallway. "Willan, I'm going to remove Gamling's sutures. I'm going to need willow bark boiled in water and my small knives and sewing scissors. We also need hot water for a bath." She leaned in and loudly whispered. "He reeks and I can’t stand it anymore."  She turned and continued down the hallway, turning the corner.  

	Willan looked at Gamling appraisingly. *Well?* 

	Gamling answered with the age - old fist pump. 


	***YES!*** 


	"Gamling!" 

	"I’m behind you!" He scurried down the hall and turned the corner. "See? I’m right here!" 

	"You are such a man!" 

	Willan shook his head, amused by the two. With a grin, he ambled towards the kitchens. 

*** 

	Gamling found himself sitting on the stool, half naked, arms over his head, with the beginnings of a sizable hard on, while Aefre carefully cut the dried stitches from his wound. "This mended quite nicely." 

	"Hmm, hmm." 

	Willan and two others were already bringing pails of hot water and were now entering with several more. "I'm glad Eadignes was able to sew you." 


	***uh oh*** 


	"Hmm Hm." 

	"I... I don’t know what I would have done had she not come up."  She tugged the last thread and brushed the skin with the willow bark water again. "There you go! All done! She was a great help." 

	"Hmm, hmm." 

	"She stayed with me all night, watching you." 

	Gamling rose from the stool, stretching, testing the pull of his skin. 

	"She did a-" 

	"Aefre? Where is this going?" Aefre looked up at him, the circles under his eyes, the additional lines on his face. Although not as bad as the first nights he had returned, he still had nightmares, calling out, thrashing. At some time, he was going to have to talk; up to this point, he had been remarkably close lipped. 

	"I don't wish to talk about Eadignes. If it is your desire to deride-" 

	"NO!" Aefre was aghast. "No! Absolutely not! She was a great help to me! I... I..." she hooked her fingers and fidgeted, "I... like her. She has a good heart." The familiar calloused fingers curled under Aefre's chin, lifted it. 

	"You have ever been wise, My Lady." He studied her face, scrutinizing it as intensely as he had the morning he had left the tent at the Dwimberg, strong fingers stoking her jaw line. 

	"Should I inhale?" Aefre asked when he lowered his head. 

	"Might be wise." 

	The initial touch was tentative, curious, contours and crevices not forgotten, but needing re-exploring. Nights of restlessness followed by nights wrapped in a cloak and summer linens guided to need and rising heat.  Somewhere, someone growled, the other whimpered, the kiss deepening. Aefre was mindful of tender flesh, her hand dipping to his lower hip as she pulled him closer, answering an ancient- 

	"Ahem." Excuse me?" 

	The two broke away, Aefre's head thumping against Gamling's chest, the Horse Lord groaning in frustration.  He glared over Aefre's shoulder. "What?" 

	Willan stood, inspecting the ceiling for cracks and miscellaneous objects. One of the younger men helping was red as a beet, staring at the rug beneath his feet, tracing the pattern with his toe; the other more courageous one, twisting his tunic into a knot. "The bath is full... uhm... just thought you would like to know..."

	"Thank you." Gamling said curtly between clenched teeth. He waited as the trio filed out, leather boots scuffing softly over rug and stone. When the door shut behind Willan, he began to tuck and pull at the ties of Aefre's overdress. "Where are your hair and bathing soaps?" 

	She traced the long scar, still angry, still slightly red and puckered. "They are in the antechambers. I’ve stayed here for so... why? What are you doing?" 

	Gamling tugged her overdress over her hips and watched it fall in a heap
