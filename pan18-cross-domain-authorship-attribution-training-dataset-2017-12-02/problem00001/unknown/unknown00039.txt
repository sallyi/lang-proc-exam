What he gotten instead was a bloody nose. There had been no more talks after that.

Harry was checking the Marauder's map again. By now he had figured out where Draco always disappeared to- the Room of Requirement. Stars knew what he did in there. But Draco wasn't in there, at the moment. He was in the ladies room a floor below him.

''Don't... tell me what's wrong... I can help you'...' Myrtle's voice trailed off as Draco shook his head. ''No one can help me.'', he said, clutching the sink until his knuckles turned white, tears streeking down his hollow cheeks. ''I can't do it'', he said, ''I can't... It won't work... and unless I do it soon... he says he'll kill me.'' Draco raised his head and looked at his broken self in the broken mirror. For the fracture of a second, he saw Harry standing in the doorway. The last person he wanted to see. 'Look at me. I'm invisible.', he thought. Then he attacked.

Myrtle was screaming. Begging the boys to stop, before someone got hurt, before someone di- she choked. Curses were crashing hard into the stalls, the walls, jinxes raining down onto the floor and cracking the tiles. ''Cruci-'' the blond, broken one started, but didn't finish as the dark, famous one shouted 'SECTUMSEMPRA!'' Blood everywhere. Blood tinting the water, so much blood, all over the floor, all over that boy, he was bleeding, his body ripped open by violent slashes. ''No... I didn't ...'' the dark one started, but Myrtle couldn't take it anymore. ''MURDER!'', she screamed, images flashing through her mind, wands, curses, a giant snake with yellow eyes, ''MURDER! IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!''

'To die at the hands of the boy who lived', Draco thought, as he passed out, unaware of Harry kneeling by his side, unaware of Harry being pushed away by Snape who had burst into the room like an explosion, unknowing wether he would be saved this time or not... and entirely uncaring.

''Draco, Draco, you're not a killer.'', Dumbledore said, standing on top of Hogwart's highest tower, poisoned and crumbling. And yet, he was conversing with Draco about various attempts at his own assassination as if it were a summer day and he was commenting on a lovely breeze. Most of it blew right through Harry's mind anyways. But those words kept echoing in his head over and over. 'Draco, you're not a killer. Draco, please. Draco.' And Draco kept talking. Revealed every one of his plans, everything he had done, and Harry, paralyzed on the floor as he was under his cloak, realized what he should have seen ages ago; that Draco had only ever tried to protect him. From the break-up letter to the broken nose, all to keep Harry away and out of harm's reach, all the time putting himself, his own life on the line. 'I will end the man who did this to us', Harry thought, his resolve being forged like steel with every word Draco hammered into his mind. 'I will end Lord Voldemort. For you, for me, for mom and dad... I know how to do it now. I will hunt down every piece of his soul... and I will crush it.'

''Draco, come here. Take a good look at him. Is that Harry Potter?'' Nine months had passed since Harry had last seen his ex. Nine months, and yet here they were again, in another deadly situation,  right under the roof of Draco's parents. Now Harry understood how Draco had grown up to be so paranoid. ''I... I don't know...'', Draco said, avoiding Harry's gaze just as much as Harry was avoiding his. ''Come on Draco, take a closer look at him!'', Lucius urged his son. ''If we would be the ones to deliver him to the Dark Lord... all would be forgiven...'' 'It is not His forgiveness that is needed here, father', Draco thought quietly.

They had taken Granger like he knew they would. As Bellatrix tortured her and his parents stood by to watch, Draco snuck into the family cellar. When he opened the door, he barely registered that half of the prisoners were out of their bonds and that Harry looked like himself again, or that Weasley looked about ready to attack. He took a deep breath and said ''I'm sorry you got caught. I'm sorry for everything. But I can get you out of here. Can you forgive me?'' Harry gave him his widest grin.

Dobby came and took the other prisoners away. As only Harry and Weasley remained, who would not leave without Granger, Draco knew it was time. He placed his hand on Harry
